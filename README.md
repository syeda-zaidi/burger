# the Burger app!

This application was created using:

Node.js
Express
MySQL
Handlebars

How it works:
The app lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the right portion of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area also has a Devour it! button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the left part of the page.

The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
